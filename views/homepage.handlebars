{{!-- Your file/folder structure MUST be set up this way for Handlebars.js to work correctly. 
You will always have a main layout located at (and named) views/layouts/main.handlebars. 
All other template files will go directly in the views folder (views/welcome.handlebars). --}}

<ol class="post-list">
    {{#each posts as |post|}}
    <li>
        <article class="post">
            <div class="title">
                <a href="{{post.post_url}}" target="_blank">{{post.title}}</a>
                <span>({{post.post_url}})</span>
            </div>
            <div class="meta">
                {{post.vote_count}} point(s) by {{post.user.username}} on
                {{post.created_at}}
                |
                <a href="/post/{{post.id}}">{{post.comments.length}} comment(s)</a>

    {{/each}}
</ol>

{{!-- Within the {{#each}} block, Handlebars.js is smart enough to know that it's working with an object on each iteration, 
so it looks for the necessary properties. We can make this a little clearer, however, by declaring a variable name in the 
#each expression and using that name for the subsequent placeholders. --}}
