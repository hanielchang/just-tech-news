{{!-- Your file/folder structure MUST be set up this way for Handlebars.js to work correctly. 
You will always have a main layout located at (and named) views/layouts/main.handlebars. 
All other template files will go directly in the views folder (views/welcome.handlebars). --}}

<ol class="post-list">
    {{#each posts as |post|}}
    <li>
        {{> post-info post }}
    </li>
    {{/each}}
</ol>

{{!-- Within the {{#each}} block, Handlebars.js is smart enough to know that it's working with an object on each iteration, 
so it looks for the necessary properties. We can make this a little clearer, however, by declaring a variable name in the 
#each expression and using that name for the subsequent placeholders. --}}
